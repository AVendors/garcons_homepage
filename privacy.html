            <h5>SECTION 1 - Overview</h5><br />

The Privacy Policy is a part of the Terms of Service (also the "Terms") which apply to all aspects of this Privacy Policy. The terms "GARÇONS," "we,” “our,” and "us" include GARÇONS, Inc., and our affiliates and subsidiaries. The Privacy Policy explains our online and offline information practices, the kinds of information we may collect, how we intend to use and share that information, and how you can opt out of a use or correct or change such information. Unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.<br /><br />
            
            <h5>SECTION 2 - Scope</h5><br />
            
            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you engage with our Service. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website, application, product, software, service, or content that are offered by third parties or that link to their own privacy statement, privacy policy, or privacy notice. GARÇONS is located in the United States.

Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.<br /><br />
            
            <h5>SECTION 3 - Personal Information</h5><br />
            
            Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Service, to administer your use of the Service, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Service. The categories of personal information we collect depend on whether you are a customer, user, applicant or visitor, and the requirements of applicable law.<br /><br />
            
            <h5>SECTION 4 - How we share information</h5><br />
            
            We do not sell your personal information.

            <h5>SECTION 6 - Data Retention</h5><br />

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.<br /><br />
            
            <h5>SECTION 8 - SMS / MMS Mobile Messaging Marketing Program</h5><br />
            
            We respect your privacy. In connection with our Mobile Message Program, we will only use information you provide to us to transmit your mobile messages and respond to you, if necessary. WE DO NOT SELL, RENT, LOAN, TRADE, LEASE, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER FOR PROFIT ANY PHONE NUMBERS OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION COLLECTED TO ANY THIRD PARTY.<br /><br />
            
            <h5>SECTION 9 - OTHER</h5><br />
            
            As our organization changes over time, this Privacy Policy is expected to change as well. We reserve the right to amend the Privacy Policy at any time, for any reason, and without notice to you other than the posting of the updated Privacy Policy on our Service. We may email periodic reminders of our notices and terms and conditions, but you should check our Service frequently to see the current Privacy Policy that is in effect and any changes that may have been made to it.<br /><br />
